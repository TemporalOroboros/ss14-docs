# Chemistry 1984 [Veritius, Unapproved]
Basically, the goal here is to absolutely fuck over the chem dispenser and instead force people to leave their little goblin burrows and interact with people to go get chems.

## Chem sources
All base reagents should be able to be gotten from at least three sources, in case of a department not being occupied or w/e.

### Atmos
Gas condensers can be used to take gases from pipes, and turn it into reagents. This is how you'd get stuff like oxygen, hydrogen, etc.

### Botany
Various plants provide basic reagents like carbon, water, and hydrogen, as well as organic reagents.

### Cargo
You can buy some reagents from cargo at a massive markup. You can get things that are more rare here, like radium.

### Science
Science should be able to synthesise very rare reagents with special machines. They should *not* be able to make everything in their department.

### Salvage/Mining
Salvage should be a source for metals, like iron or copper.
